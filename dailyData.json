{"image_data":{"date":"2018-04-09","title":"The Sun Unleashed: Monster Filament in Ultraviolet","explanation":"One of the most spectacular solar sights is an explosive flare. In 2011 June, the Sun unleashed somewhat impressive, medium-sized solar flare as rotation carried active regions of sunpots toward the solar limb. That flare, though, was followed by an astounding gush of magnetized plasma -- a monster filament seen erupting at the Sun's edge in this extreme ultraviolet image from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory. Featured here is a time-lapse video of that hours-long event showing darker, cooler plasma raining down across a broad area of the Sun's surface, arcing along otherwise invisible magnetic field lines. An associated coronal mass ejection, a massive cloud of high energy particles, was blasted in the general direction of the Earth,and made a glancing blow to Earth's magnetosphere.","url":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rZAA5SYLZU?rel=0","media_type":"video"},"nlp_data0":{"name":"Sun Unleashed: Monster Filament","salience":0.4930199682712555},"nlp_data1":{"name":"sights","salience":0.10502330213785172},"nlp_data2":{"name":"UltravioletOne","salience":0.06327442824840546},"track_data":{"name":"You Might Feel This, Too","album":"Sights & Sounds","artist":"Arbour","uri":"spotify:track:683hRieVmYdAhVA1DkjSAk","song_available":"true"}}
