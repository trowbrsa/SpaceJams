{"image_data":{"date":"2018-04-02","title":"Moons, Rings, Shadows, Clouds: Saturn (Cassini)","explanation":"While cruising around Saturn, be on the lookout for picturesque juxtapositions of moons, rings, and shadows. One quite picturesque arrangement occurred in 2005 and was captured by the then Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft. In the featured image, moons Tethys and Mimas are visible on either side of Saturn's thin rings, which are seen nearly edge-on.  Across the top of Saturn are dark shadows of the wide rings, exhibiting their impressive complexity. The violet-light image brings up the texture of the backdrop: Saturn's clouds. Cassini orbited Saturn from 2004 until September of last year, when the robotic spacecraft was directed to dive into Saturn to keep it from contaminating any moons.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1804/SaturnRingsMoons_Cassini_967.jpg","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1804/SaturnRingsMoons_Cassini_967.jpg","media_type":"image"},"nlp_data0":{"name":"moons","salience":0.11624516546726227},"nlp_data1":{"name":"rings","salience":0.11624516546726227},"nlp_data2":{"name":"lookout","salience":0.0936737135052681},"nlp_data3":{"name":"juxtapositions","salience":0.0936737135052681},"nlp_data4":{"name":"Saturn","salience":0.08786030113697052},"track_data":{"name":"Moons","album":"Moons","artist":"Embee","uri":"spotify:track:4t4uk0wS8mvGwuAsGW9TB8","song_available":"true"}}
